** Changes for 1.0-beta3-b2 ** [18-3-2010]
------------------------------------------

    - Based on user feedback of the source code, the code has now been reorganized to clearly separate the public API
    into a separate JAR file. This will ensure that user developed code will not accidentally link with the UltraESB
    internals.

    - The API JAR is published at the AdroitLogic Maven 2 repository at : http://downloads.adroitlogic.com/maven2

    - The above change removes the static methods of the Mediation class, and makes Mediation an interface. An instance
    is now passed as the variable "mediation" into a sequence, and could be used to invoke the same mediation routines
    as before. Message, Mediation and Configuration are the main

    - The full public API of the UltraESB is published at http://api.adroitlogic.org/

    - The UltraRuntime project files provided to develop with the UltraESB are mainly tested only against IntelliJ
    IDEA Community Edition 9.0 - which is available as free and open source software. The Eclipse and Netbeans files
    are provided-as-is, and we welcome any improvements to them from users.

=== Appendix B ===

This appendix describes the detailed re-factoring of Mediation API for version 1.7.0 from previous releases. The left side
shows the pre v1.7.0 mediation API methods and the right side shows the same from v1.7.0 onwards with the support interfaces.

Support interfaces improves the usability of the API, by grouping the similar operations into a single interface.

To migrate any pre v1.7.0 configuration to a v1.7.0 or later configuration, please refer the following tables, and/or
request for free assistance from AdroitLogic via any preferred support chanel. Please note that the previous API methods
are still available as deprecated and planned to be removed in a next version of the UltraESB and hence migrating to the
new API is highly recommended.

=== Appendix C ===

This appendix describes the detailed re-factoring of AS2 persistence layer DB schema for version 2.0.0 from previous
releases. The left side shows the pre v2.0.0 schema table column names while the right side shows the same from v2.0.0
onwards.

To migrate any pre v2.0.0 schema to a v2.0.0 or later schema, you will need to add few columns into some tables and
change some properties of the schema too. All those properties are described next to the changed column.

Please consult AdroitLogic for further support on migrating the existing AS2 system into the new version.


PARTNER Table
*************

** The Table name itself has been changed from "PARTNER" to "partner". Note the case of the letters. This change is only
applicable to databases case sensitive naming. (most of the databases are case sensitive, including MySQL and many other)

applicable to databases case sensitive naming. (most of the databases are case sensitive, including MySQL and many other)

=== Appendix D ===

This appendix describes the detailed re-factoring of UTerm command names for the 2.0.0 release from previous
releases. The left side shows the pre v2.0.0 commands while the right side shows the same from v2.0.0
onwards.

The rationale behind this refactoring is to make the UTerm commands consistent across the norms. The change is mainly
on bringing the subject as a first class entity to the command over the action. For example "list-endpoints" (previously
action first - "list"), will be now "endpoint-list" (subject first "endpoint")

Please consult AdroitLogic for further support on migrating the existing scripts using these commands to the newer
version.
