            <section>Round-Robin graceful restart is considered as the most safe cluster restart, where only one
            server node in the cluster is being restarted at a given time, yet it is done gracefully. You could
            specify a delay for this cluster restart so that there will be a delay of the specified amount in milliseconds
            between the restarts of the individual nodes in the cluster. This guarantees the availability of the cluster
            while being restarted, but it may be inconsistent in state, if restart results in a different configuration. You
            could specify a maximum grace period in-case if the restart operation cannot finalize the tasks before the maximum
                grace period, it will force a hard restart at that moment.
            This restart is going to take the most time to complete out of the 4 options.</section>

        <div>
            <section>Round-Robin hard restart guarantees the availability but it might cause some messages to be dropped. That is
            because the restart of the individual nodes in the cluster is not graceful. You could specify the delay between the individual
            node restarts, so that there will be a delay of the specified amount in milliseconds between restarts. This restart is not safe as the
            first option but takes less time than that. If you do not want to make sure the restart to be delayed for serving the already
            accepted messages you may use this restart.</section>

        <h3><a href="#">Graceful restart the complete cluster now</a></h3>
        <div>
            <section>Graceful restarts the cluster, but all nodes at nearly the same time. It doesn't guarantee the availability
            of the cluster as all nodes are going down nearly at the same time, so there is a down time for the cluster. If you have an option to
            decouple the load from the cluster and you quickly want to get the complete cluster restarted ASAP, you could use this. This is graceful
            meaning that, if a server node has messages in processing state, they will be finished before the restart, provided that they are
            finished before the maximum grace period specified. This is suitable if the restart changes the configuration, as the cluster inconsistency
            in configuration is nearly zero in this restart.</section>

            the complete cluster instantly without worrying about the availability nor the messages in flight (in processing).
            This restart is the quickest among all but should be used with care. In other words do not invoke this restart if you
